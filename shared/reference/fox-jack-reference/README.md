##  Step 1. Print the Cases

You can use:

- Supported Materials: PLA+, PETG, ABS

> [!NOTE]
> Do **not** use **non-FDM** printers (e.g. resin printers), since heat-set inserts won’t work with those materials.

---

## Step 2. Insert Heat-Set Inserts

- You can use a soldering iron or a dedicated tool
- Gently press the inserts into place while heating

> **Note**: Assembly images are not available in this repository.

## Step 3. Add Fiber to LED Holes (Optional, But Looks Awesome)

- Plastic fiber makes LED glow look much better
- Push fiber into LED holes
